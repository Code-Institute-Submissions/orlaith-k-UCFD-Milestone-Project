Photography Portfolio Webpage

For this project I decided to build a photography portfolio webpage. I decided to go for a single webpage instead of a website with multiple pages in order to 
create something that is easily navigable for the end-user.

I am an amateur photographer myself, so this idea was something that not only would be exciting for me to work on but something I also believe fulfilled the 
requirements of the project. To keep the webpage simple for the purpose of this project, I have decided to focus on two categories for the “Portfolio” section; 
nature and architecture.


UX

The webpage was built for end-users such as other photographers looking to collaborate, potential clients, or individuals interested in checking out photography online; possibly for inspiration.

For example:

“As an art student, I am working on an assignment about architecture styles. This webpage shows the examples I am talking about in my essay, 
and I can contact the owner for permission to use their images.”

“As a photographer, I am interested in collaborating with someone on a nature photography project. From a quick search, 
I found this webpage and I can clearly see this person’s style is exactly what I’m looking for in a project partner.”

“As a writer, I am working on a piece about local historic building and need someone who would be able to capture the various architectural styles in my city. 
This webpage showcases the type of approach I am looking for, and I can easily contact the owner with a request to team up on this assignment.”

The webpage project was based on a simple idea, as can be seen in the wireframe below, of a single page, with a header / hero image section, and 3 following sections 
(an about section, a portfolio section, and a contact form).

FEATURES

Existing Features

1.	A simple navigation system allows the end-user to make their way around the page with ease. The “About”, “Contact”, and “Portfolio” links will bring 
    the user to each respective section, and below the contact form, there is a “Back to Top” button which will allow the user to return to the top of the page.

2.	The header section also contains social links for the user to check out my various social media pages.

3.	The about section gives the user information on who I am, what I do, and what inspires my work. This could be particularly useful for collaborators / clients 
    to get to know me and see if I am the right fit for a specific project.

4.	The portfolio section contains two simple Bootstrap galleries which showcase my work. This allows the end-user to get a clear picture of my photography style. 
    The galleries are made up of 4 columns, and reduces to 2 columns on smaller screens

5.	A contact form which enables the end-user to contact me with any requests, questions, or comments if they so wish.


Features to Implement

Another feature I think would be useful to implement in the future would be a portfolio section that contains more categories and sub-categories, 
but with a smaller but more interactive gallery. Perhaps a single image view the user can swipe through to see more images in that category / sub-category


TECHNOLOGIES USED

1.	Bootstrap 4.4.1

Used for bootstrap styling across the webpage

2.	Font Awesome 4.7

Used to bring in font awesome icons such as social icons and the arrow icon for the “back to top” feature
https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/


TESTING

For testing I accessed the webpage on different devices and looked at varying screen sizes on each device, in different browsers in order to ensure my 
webpage appears properly on the screen. 

I accessed the webpage on two different laptops, using Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge, and also on smartphones and tablets including a OnePlus phone, 
and Lenovo tablet; again on different browsers, and tested each feature and ensure everything worked as it should.
